# Life-Below-Water

Concept Note: Life Below Water
Background:
The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. Oceans cover three-quarters of the Earth's surface and contain 97% of the Earth's water. They are vital for global systems that make the planet habitable, such as regulating climate, providing oxygen, and serving as a source of food and livelihood for billions of people. However, marine environments are under threat from pollution, overfishing, habitat destruction, and climate change.
